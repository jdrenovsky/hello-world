# hello-world
This is the repository in which I am testing out GitHub's basic functionality

Hey world. I'm engaging in the classic development trope of creating a "Hello world" branch so that I can have a working playground for my learning.
I'm hoping to leverage this into being the best DevOps Engineer I can for my company over time. 

P.S. - I'm a Mechanical Engineer by degree, with very little classroom dev training. Don't tell anyone!!!
